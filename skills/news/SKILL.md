# News Research Skill

Research news topics end-to-end using the NewsAPI MCP server. This skill orchestrates the right tool sequence for different question types and formats findings for export.

## Usage

- `/news "What's happening with AI regulation?"` — run a full research workflow
- `/news` — interactive mode, asks for the research question

## Rules

1. **Sequential requests only** — never fire multiple NewsAPI calls in parallel (max 5 concurrent allowed by API, but sequential is safer and required by server instructions)
2. **Deduplicate by default** — use `isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"` in all scan steps
3. **Track usage** — read the "Tokens used" footer from every response and report totals at the end

## Workflow: suggest → scan → triage → retrieve

### Step 1: Suggest — resolve names to URIs
`suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "Tesla"})` → get conceptUri
Always resolve entity names before searching. Keyword search is a fallback.

### Step 2: Scan — retrieve titles only
`search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<uri>", count: 100, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"})`
Fetch up to 100 articles with NO bodies — returns only titles, dates, sources, and URIs. Very token-efficient. Use `isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"` to remove wire syndication noise.

### Step 3: Triage — assess relevance
Read the titles from step 2. Select the articles relevant to the user's question by their URIs. If too few relevant results, paginate (`articlesPage: 2`) and repeat step 2.

### Step 4: Retrieve — get full details
`get_article_details({articleUri: ["<uri1>", "<uri2>", "<uri3>", ...]})`
Pass up to 100 URIs per call. If you have more than 100 relevant articles, batch them into multiple calls of 100 URIs each. Add `includeFields` only for data you need.

### Choosing the search kind
- **kind: "articles"** → individual articles, full text, specific sources
- **kind: "events"** → high-level overview, deduplicated event clusters, "what's happening with X"

The same pattern applies to events: scan with `search({kind: "events"})` → triage → `get_event_details` with selected URIs.

### When to simplify
- Quick lookups (known URI): go directly to `get_article_details`
- Topic page monitoring: use `get_topic_page_articles`
- Simple questions needing few results: `search({kind: "articles", count: 10})` (skip triage)

## Citation Format

**CRITICAL: Every factual claim MUST have an inline Markdown link to its source.** This is the single most important formatting rule. A report without clickable source links is incomplete.

- Embed **inline Markdown links** after every factual claim: `[Reuters](URL)`
- The URL comes from the article's `url` field in the tool response — never fabricate URLs
- Reuse the same link when citing the same article multiple times
- If the same source has multiple articles, disambiguate: `[Reuters 1](URL1)` `[Reuters 2](URL2)`
- If a URL is missing, cite by title and source name without a link: *"Title" (Source Name)*
- **No separate Sources section** — all attribution lives inline
- **Self-check before presenting:** scan your output — if any factual sentence lacks a `[Source](URL)` link, add one before responding
- **URL availability:** Article URLs come from `get_article_details` responses (the `url` field). For event-based patterns, you can also get article URLs directly from events: `get_event_details({eventUri: "<uri>", resultType: "articles", articlesCount: 10, articlesArticleBodyLen: 0})` returns articles (with URLs) for that event — no bodies needed, just URLs for inline citations. Note: `resultType: "articles"` only works with a single `eventUri`, not an array.

## Report Structure

Every research report (except Quick Lookup) must follow this order:

1. **Summary** — 3-5 sentences with inline references covering the key findings
2. **Detailed coverage** — subsections organized by theme, with inline references on every claim
3. **Usage footer** — `**NewsAPI usage:** {N} requests | {T} tokens consumed`

## Content Rules

- **Max one short quote (<15 words) per source article** — paraphrase everything else
- **Synthesize across sources** — do not reconstruct or closely follow any single article's structure
- Missing URL → cite by title and source name (no link)

## Decision Tree

Classify the user's question, then follow the matching pattern:

```
Question
├─ "What's happening with X?" ─────────→ Event Overview
├─ Needs full text / quotes ────────────→ Article Deep Dive
├─ "How does Source A vs B cover X?" ───→ Source Comparison
├─ "What's the sentiment around X?" ────→ Sentiment Analysis
├─ Economic topic (GDP, inflation, ...) → Economic Report
├─ Political topic (policy, elections) ─→ Political Report
├─ Investment/market/company analysis ──→ Investing Report
├─ Multi-angle research question ───────→ Research Report
├─ Due diligence / adverse media / KYC ─→ Adverse Media Report
├─ Company profile / entity intelligence → Company Intelligence Report
├─ Supply chain / operational disruption → Supply Chain Risk Report
├─ Country risk / geopolitical risk ─────→ Geopolitical Risk Report
├─ Topic page URI provided ─────────────→ Topic Page
└─ Quick factual / few results needed ──→ Quick Lookup
```

## Patterns

### 1. Event Overview

Use when the user wants a high-level summary of what's happening with a topic.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<topic>"})` — resolve URI
2. `search({kind: "events", conceptUri: "<uri>", forceMaxDataTimeWindow: 31, count: 50, sortBy: "date"})` — scan events
3. Triage — select relevant event URIs from titles/summaries
4. `get_event_details({eventUri: ["<uri1>", "<uri2>", ...], includeFields: "concepts,categories"})` — retrieve details
5. For each key event, fetch article URLs: `get_event_details({eventUri: "<uri>", resultType: "articles", articlesCount: 10, articlesArticleBodyLen: 0})` — returns articles with URLs directly, no need for `search` or `get_article_details`
6. Use the article URLs from step 5 to provide inline citation links for each event's claims
7. Present findings using the **findings template**

### 2. Article Deep Dive

Use when the user needs full article text, quotes, or detailed coverage.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<topic>"})` — resolve URI
2. `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<uri>", count: 100, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"})` — scan titles
3. Triage — select relevant article URIs
4. `get_article_details({articleUri: ["<uri1>", "<uri2>", ...], includeFields: "sentiment"})` — retrieve full text
5. Present findings using the **findings template**

### 3. Source Comparison

Use when comparing how different outlets cover the same topic.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<topic>"})` — resolve topic URI
2. `suggest({type: "sources", prefix: "<source A>"})` — resolve source A URI
3. `suggest({type: "sources", prefix: "<source B>"})` — resolve source B URI
4. `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<topic-uri>", sourceUri: "<sourceA-uri>", count: 50, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"})` — scan source A
5. `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<topic-uri>", sourceUri: "<sourceB-uri>", count: 50, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates"})` — scan source B
6. Triage — pick representative articles from each source
7. `get_article_details({articleUri: ["<a1>", "<a2>", "<b1>", "<b2>", ...], includeFields: "sentiment"})` — retrieve full text
8. Present findings using the **source comparison template**

### 4. Sentiment Analysis

Use when analyzing tone/sentiment around a topic or entity.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<entity>"})` — resolve URI
2. `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<uri>", count: 100, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates", includeFields: "sentiment"})` — scan with sentiment
3. Triage — group by positive (>0.3), negative (<-0.3), neutral
4. `get_article_details({articleUri: ["<selected-uris>"], includeFields: "sentiment"})` — retrieve representative articles
5. Present findings using the **sentiment template**

### 5. Topic Page

Use when the user provides a topic page URI or wants monitored topic updates.

1. `get_topic_page_articles({uri: "<topic-page-uri>", articlesCount: 20, articleBodyLen: 200})` — get latest articles
2. Present findings using the **findings template**

### 6. Economic Report

Use when the question is about economic indicators, macro trends, or sector/industry performance.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<economic topic>"})` — resolve URI (e.g., "inflation", "semiconductor industry")
2. `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<uri>", count: 100, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates", keyword: "GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rate, recession, growth, forecast, central bank, trade deficit, earnings", keywordOper: "or"})` — scan with economic keywords. Translate keywords to match the language of the task.
3. Triage — select articles covering economic data, policy decisions, sector trends
4. `get_article_details({articleUri: ["<uri1>", "<uri2>", ...], includeFields: "concepts,categories"})` — retrieve full text
5. Present findings using the **economic template**

### 7. Political Report

Use when the question involves policy, legislation, elections, or geopolitics.

1. `suggest({type: "concepts", prefix: "<political topic>"})` — resolve URI

6. Optionally, for deeper coverage beyond events: `search({kind: "articles", conceptUri: "<uri>", count: 100, articleBodyLen: 0, isDuplicateFilter: "skipDuplicates", keyword: "legislation, regulation, policy, vote, amendment, coalition, campaign, reform, mandate, opposition", keywordOper: "or"})` — translate keywords to match the language of the task. Triage and `get_article_details` for selected URIs.
7. Present findings using the **political template**

### 8. Investing Report

## Suggest Fallback Strategy

If `suggest` returns no results:

1. Try a **shorter prefix** (e.g., "Tesla" instead of "Tesla Inc.")
2. Try **English** if you used another language
3. Try a **broader concept** (e.g., "Olympic Games" instead of "2026 Winter Olympics")
4. Fall back to **keyword search** as last resort

For precision with broad concepts, combine: `conceptUri: "Olympic Games"` + `keyword: "2026"`

## Findings Export

Always format the final output using the appropriate template from `skill/templates/`. Use inline citations (see Citation Format above) — no separate Sources table. Every research session MUST end with the usage footer.

### Template Selection

| Pattern | Template |
|---------|----------|
| Event Overview | `findings.md` — summary + detailed coverage with inline citations |
| Article Deep Dive | `findings.md` — summary + detailed coverage with inline citations |
| Sentiment Analysis | `sentiment.md` — sentiment breakdown with inline citations |
| Economic Report | `economic.md` — macro context + sector focus + outlook with inline citations |
| Political Report | `political.md` — policy + dynamics + geopolitical context + stakeholder reactions |
| Investing Report | `investing.md` — developments + risks + opportunities + catalysts & key dates |
| Research Report | `research.md` — executive summary + key takeaways + multi-perspective analysis + limitations |
| Topic Page | `findings.md` — summary + detailed coverage with inline citations |
| Quick Lookup | No template (concise answer with inline citations) |
| Adverse Media Report | `adverse-media.md` — adverse findings + associated entities + gaps |
| Company Intelligence Report | `company-intel.md` — corporate activity + strategy + regulatory + key people |
| Supply Chain Risk Report | `supply-chain.md` — disruptions + trade risks + mitigation + outlook |
| Geopolitical Risk Report | `geopolitical.md` — stability + security + diplomacy + humanitarian + actors |

### Usage Footer (mandatory)

Every response except Quick Lookup must end with:

```
**NewsAPI usage:** {N} requests | {T} tokens consumed
```

Count every tool call as a request. Read the exact "Tokens used" number from each response footer — do not estimate. Suggest calls cost 0 tokens but still count as requests.

## Token Budget Awareness

Approximate token costs per action:

| Action | Tokens |
|--------|--------|
| suggest | 0 (free) |
| search articles (scan, bodyLen: 0) | 1-2 |
| search articles (with body) | 5-10 |
| search events | 1-2 |
| get_article_details (per batch) | 5-15 |
| get_event_details (per batch) | 2-5 |
| get_topic_page_articles | 1-5 |

A typical Event Overview costs ~5-10 tokens. A full Article Deep Dive costs ~10-20 tokens. Plan accordingly if the user has limited quota.
